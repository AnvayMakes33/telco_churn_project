Customer Churn Prediction Model
Model to predicts which telecom customers are likely to cancel their subscriptions.
Highlights
78.4% prediction accuracy using Random Forest
Identifies top risk factors: monthly charges, contract type, and tenure
Handles class imbalance with data balancing techniques
Generates actionable insights for customer retention
Overview
Hi everyone! Thanks for taking the time to read my project. This project analyzes telecom customer data to predict churn, which is the rate at which consumers cancel their subscriptions. This was built as a learning project with the goal to understand machine learning as an extension of data projects I've already learned about using R in the past.
The dataset contains 7,032 customers from IBM, and the final model achieved 78.4% accuracy in predicting who would leave. Through this project, I learned about handling imbalanced data, training Random Forest models, and identifying which customer features (like monthly charges and contract type) actually matter for predicting churn.
